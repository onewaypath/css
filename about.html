  <p>
    One Way Path Group is part of a
    <a href="images/affiliates.pdf"
      >network of meditation centres and temples</a
    >
    run by students of the late Venerable Ajahn Tong Sirimangalo (Ajahn Tong).
    We operate under the spritual direction of Ajahn Tong, Venerable Ajahn
    Dhammo Tach Troung of the Khmer Krom Buddhist Temple in Stoney Creek,
    Ontario and Ajahn Tong's senior diciples, Thanat Chindaporn and Kathryn
    Johnston Chindaporn.

  <p>
    The signifacnce of Ajahn Tong's teachings is currenly under reported in
    popular media but his contribution, and that Thanat and Kathryn Chindaporn,
    to the field of Buddhist meditation are among the word's most significant of
    recent times.

  <p>
    Over the centuries after the death of the Buddha, some of his most imporant
    teachings on meditation fell into obscurity within Buddhist communities. At
    the same time, the concept of mindfulness as a spritual practice began to
    diverge from those same specific teachings of the Buddha. The divergence is
    likely to have occured because of the inaccessability of teachings in their
    original language, Pali, and the limited size of the monastic communities in
    which the practice had been kept up as an oral tradition.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, at the turn of the 20th century, a Burmese monastic teacher known
    as the Mahasi Sayadaw began reviving these lost teachings. The teachings
    consisted of mental noting as central to the Buddha's defintion of
    mindfulness. Although the instruction for mental noting -- as an imperative
    of mindfulness rather than an optional component -- is prolific throughout
    the written text of the Buddha's words, the Pali term which represents it
    "Satima" had not been correctly translated. Furthermore, markers of a
    successful insight meditation practice known as the Stages of Insight
    Knowledge had been relegeted to the status of mere commentary on the text
    when in fact the Buddha had given the the Stages of Insight Knowledge pride
    of place winthin the first few words he spoke after attaining enlightenment.
    Again, recognition of the importantance of the Stages of Insight Knowledge
    fell into abyeance because the Pali language had not been properly
    translated into the western the vernacular.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mahasi Sayada's invaluable work in reviving the Buddha's Insight
    Meditation Teachings was successful in reigniting the practice in Myannmar
    (Burma) and his teaching spread to other Buddhist countries including
    Thailand. However, the practice still remainded somewhat inaccessible to
    westerners because of the long time periods that were required to engage
    with the practice and its location in Myannmar which is less popular as a
    tourist destination. Furtunately, during the lifetime of the Mahasi Sayadaw,
    Ajahn Tong gained knowledge of the practice and became proficient in it to
    the extent that only a few weeks of practice is now required in order to see
    dramatic results. Moreover, because of his clear elucidation of the Stages
    of Insight Knowledge, lay meditation teachers could be trained to recognize
    correct pratice in students over a few years (rather than decades).

    During the years of his life, Ajahn Tong succeeded in building up a large
    meditation centre at the Chomtong Temple and Monestary, approximately one
    hour south of Chiang Mai, Thailand. Senior lay deciples of Ajahn Tong,
    Thanat Chindaporn and Kathryn Johnston Chindaporn also became proficient in
    the practice and built up a network of meditation centres throughout the
    world to ensure that the practice remains accessible for all human kind in
    the years to come. One Way Path Group was started by Sandra, Alex and Miriam
    Young in 2018 to contribute to this work initially at the Buddhavipassana
    Meditation Centre in Toronto and On-NÅ«m Meditation Centre in Lieberose,
    Germany (approximately 120 km south east of Berlin). As part of the work of
    developing meditiation facilities, One Way Path Group builds homes for
    Buddhist communities, led by plans to build the first of such communities in
    Stoney Creek, Ontario in the area surrounding the Khmer Krom Buddhist Temple
    under the spiritual guidance of its Abbot, Venerable Dhammo Tach Truong.
