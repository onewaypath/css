        <h2>
          I like to do yoga (or other practices) may I continue practicing
          during the retreat?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The reason we do not allow yoga or other practices during the
            retreat is because we would like you to experience the benefits of
            Vipassana meditation on its own, and because when you mix practices,
            it is difficult for the teacher to monitor your progress and make
            recommendations accordingly.

        <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You should bring a sitting cushion, comfortable white or light
            coloured clothing (e.g. jogging pants, t-shirts, sweaters, etc) and
            toiletries. We will provide you with towels and linens.

        <h2>Do I need to be a Buddhist to come?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No. Many meditators are not Buddhists, but highly benefit from the
            teachings of the Buddha.

        <h2>
          I have never practiced meditation before. Will the retreat be too much
          for me?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            This retreat is intended for beginners to take part. For many
            people, this will be their first exposure to meditation practice.
            Your teacher will adjust the retreat according to your level of
            comfort. If you have any concerns during the retreat, each student
            meets with the teacher daily, when they may ask all questions and
            voice concerns.

        <h2>Is talking permitted during the retreat?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            During the retreat, we will be observing “Noble Silence.” This means
            that talking is permitted but it should be restricted to useful
            speech, i.e., speech associated with necessities of circumstance
            (e.g. when organizing meals or for other logistical reasons) and
            when discussing your practice with the meditation teacher. You may
            also engage in limited pleasantries such as “good morning”, etc.

        <h2>How much should I donate?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            We charge a registration fee for accommodation and food provided at
            overnight retreats. While this fee is competitive compared to rates
            for accommodation at other centres, it does not include any
            remuneration for the teaching above providing for the teachers'
            expenses. Since we are unable to put a price on the value of the
            Buddha’s teaching, as a rule, we will not give you advice or any
            suggestion on how much to donate. If you choose to make a donation,
            the amount is entirely up to you.

        <h2>What is your refund policy?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Due to limited space at our centre and the need to ensure its
            financial sustainability, we regret that we are unable to accept
            refund or rebooking requests later than 1 week before the start of
            your retreat.

          Do you offer scholarships? Can I stay at the centre for free if I
          volunteer?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            To ensure financial sustainability of the centre, we regret that at
            this time we are not in a position to offer scholarships or
            accommodation in return for volunteer time.

          Do you offer retreats shorter than 2 days, evening sessions,
          non-retreat instruction ore retreats starting on another day? Can I
          leave the retreat early?
        </h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <!-- <p>At the moment, we are encouraging students to register for 15 day retreats. This helps us organizationally with regards to cleaning and preparation of rooms and to keep the centre financially sustainable so that we can continue to offer this practice to our community. Also, and importantly, it ensures that students have enough time to progress in their practice which is particularly applicable to students who are working on the basic course. We do hope that you will be able to make arrangements in your schedule to join us for a 15 day course which is the current minimum booking</p> -->
          <p>
            Currently a two-day weekend is the minimum booking, and to
            coordinate cleaning of the centre, all retreats begin on Friday. At
            present, we are not able to accommodate other start dates.

        <h2>Can I reserve a single room?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            We have one smaller single room that we have to use to balance out
            the genders. If there is an odd number of women then we assign it to
            a woman and if there is an odd number of men then we assign it to a
            man. Once we know the gender of the person who would go in the room
            based on the other bookings, it’s a question of whether any of the
            students are returning students and when they first started
            practicing with us. If they are all beginners than we assign the
            single room randomly between them. It is not available upon request.
            Students wishing to guarantee their own room, may book two spots and
            then would have a double room to themselves.
