    <ul>
      <li>4:00 AM Wake Up</li>
      <li>6:00 AM Breakfast</li>

    <p>
      The times between meals and sleep are for your practice which consists of
      the mindful prostration, walking and sitting meditation. Throughout the
      day you will alternate between these practices with breaks in between.
      During this period, we will encourage you to maintain Noble Silence which
      means that you should talk only when necessary. This will allow you to
      keep your attention on your practice and minimize outside distractions.
      You will meet with your teacher once or twice per day to discuss your
      practice. This is an opportunity for you to ask questions, and for your
      teacher to provide you with feedback.
