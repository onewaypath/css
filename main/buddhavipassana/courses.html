      <!--<p>This was one of the best things I have ever done for myself. I just wanted to thank Alex and Miriam from the bottom of my heart for this amazing experience. They helped me get though something that was bothering me for months. They were both very helpful. The place was lovely to stay, rooms were clean, food was great and anything we needed was provided to us right away. I definitely recommend this course. It is life changing. — A weekend course participant (September 2016).</p>-->
